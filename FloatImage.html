        Coffee is a brewed drink with a distinct aroma and flavor, prepared from roasted coffee beans, the see
        ds found inside  <br> "berries" of the Coffea plant. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primaril
        y in equatorial Latin America, <br> Southeast Asia, India and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly
         regarded arabica, and the less <br> sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. The latter is resistant 
         to the coffee leaf rust, Hemileia vastatrix, <br> but has a more bitter taste. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, 
         processed, and dried. Green (unroasted) coffee beans <br> are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in 
         the world. Once traded, the beans are roasted to varying <br> degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before
          being ground and brewed to create coffee. Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a <br> stimulating effect on 
          humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be 
          prepared and <br> presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies;
           however, results have <br> varied in terms of coffee's relative benefit. The majority of recent research suggests
         that moderate coffee consumption is benign or <br> mildly beneficial in healthy adults. However,
          the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart disease.
